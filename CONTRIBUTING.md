## Machine requirements for development

* [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/)

The system requirements are the same as those for .NET 8. Development can be done on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

If you want to run `makereleases.ps1` or `rununittests.ps1` scripts, you will need [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

To generate the Windows Installer, you will need [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) installed and with `makensis` added to PATH.

## I want to translate Pororoca to my language

Pororoca uses JSON files for internationalization. 

The [WebTranslateIt](https://converter.webtranslateit.com/) online tool allows you to convert those JSON files into other formats that you might feel more comfortable working on. After finishing your translations, you can convert again to JSON.

1) In the *Pororoca.Desktop.Localization.SourceGeneration* project, add your language to the enum and extensions.

2) In the *Pororoca.Desktop* project, create a new JSON file with your language strings, inside the Localization folder, and reference in AdditionalFiles inside `Pororoca.Desktop.csproj`.

3) Insert a new key in the `i18n_keys.json` file, of your language name, like: `"TopMenuLanguage/YourLanguage",`. The other language files will need a translation for this key.

4) Edit `MainWindow.xaml` and `MainWindowViewModel.cs` to add your language to the top menu.

5) (OPTIONAL) Add a README for your language.

6) (OPTIONAL) Add your language to the Windows installer: `src/Pororoca.Desktop.WindowsInstaller/Installer.nsi`.

7) If you want to translate the documentation to your language, open an issue on GitHub and I will concede access to the documentation website repo.

6) Done!

## I want to make my own colour theme

1) Create a new theme in the `Styles\Accents` folder. If your theme is dark-based, start your new theme copying from the `AmazonianNight.xaml` theme. If it is light-based, copy from the `Pampa.xaml` theme. Light-based themes require a few more colour definitions than dark-based themes.

2) Add your theme in the `Styles\Themes.xaml` and `PororocaThemeManager.cs` files. The PororocaThemeManager also controls the text editor theme and Pororoca variable highlight colour for your theme.

3) Insert a key and translations for your theme name in the Localization files. The necessary key will be: `"TopMenuTheme/YourThemeName"`.

4) Edit `MainWindow.xaml` and `MainWindowViewModel.cs` to add your theme to the top menu.

5) Done!

## I want a custom keyboard shortcut

1) If the keyboard shortcut is related to the collection tree (left-side panel), then the keybinding needs to be registered in `CollectionsGroupView.xaml`. If it is related to the main window, then the keybinding resides in the `MainWindow.xaml` file.

2) Add a ViewModel command and logic for your keyboard shortcut in the `KeyboardShortcuts.cs` file.

## I want a predefined or random variable

Edit the `PororocaPredefinedVariableEvaluator.cs` file to add your variable key and logic.

## Is there anything else I can contribute with?
